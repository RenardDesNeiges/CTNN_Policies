# Learning Motor Policies with Time Continuous Neural Networks

Repository for my semester project at EPFL's Biorobotics Laboratory (BIOROB). The goal is to train time-continuous neural networks (more specifically LTCs) for strongly non-linear control tasks (ideally locomotion of quadruped robots) using reinforcement learning.

## Plan :
- Week 1 : getting started, picking a title
- Week 2 : Understanding how LTCs work, supervised training, key properties
- Week 3 : Start of the RL work (presumably in ray RLLib), RL training of RNNs for control tasks
- Week 4 : Implementing LTCs in ray, figuring out how to make BPTT work for RL (presumably using a PPO alg)
- Week 5 : Running examples in ray
- Week > 5 : end of the receding horizon, we will see later
